ACIT4610 Evolutionary artificial intelligence and robotics

- 1. Familiarize yourself with the models (CA, networks). DONE
- 2. Implement in Python a cellular automaton which receives argument(s) to define its
- rule.
- 3. Familiarize yourself with the cart-pole balancing environment. You can install and
- prepare this environment by following the instructions on
- this link: https://gym.openai.com/docs/.
-
- 4. Come up with a method to encode input (environment observations) into the CA and
- to decode the CA state into output (action).
- 5. Come up with a fitness function that tracks the performance of the controller.
- 6. Evolve the rule of the CA to improve its control of the cart.
- 7. Expand it to a network model (a simple neural network model with binary neurons).
- Then, evolve its parameters to improve the controller.
